# Obtaining and refreshing OAuth2 tokens

Tokens are a form of short-lived, temporary authenticiation and authorization used in place of your username and password when interacting with Designsafe APIs. Designsafe tokens expire 1 hour, but can easily be refreshed.


## Obtain a token

```sh
# From your terminal interface, type:
auth-tokens-create -S -v
```

You will be prompted to enter your *API password*. Type your Designsafe password. Next, you will receive an affirmation of success in your terminal.

```sh
Token for designsafe:vaughn successfully refreshed and cached for 3600 seconds
{
    "access_token": "96797ebac3e648b9453dfe4c57b7c0",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "cc5b3dff98a930f9207e148bb22f8",
    "scope": "default",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

## Refresh your token

When your token expires in an hour, you may refresh it:

```sh
auth-tokens-refresh -S -v
Token for designsafe:vaughn successfully refreshed and cached for 3600 seconds
{
    "access_token": "3baebe5418ffce0da7fbdcb193d0ef",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "4a51a7524638e9d7ed0c3adcd3e99d5",
    "scope": "default",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}
```
