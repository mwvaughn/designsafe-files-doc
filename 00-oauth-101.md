# Creating a Oauth2 client

Designsafe's APIs use OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. Before you start working with these APIs, you will need to create a OAuth client application associated with a set of API keys. This is a one-time action, so if you already have a set of API keys, skip to the next step. If not, you can create your keys using the clients service as follows:

```sh
clients-create -S -v -N my_client -D "Client used for app development"
```

*Note:* The -N flag allows you to specify a machine-readable name for your application; -D provides the description, and -S option stores your API keys for future use, so you will not need to manually enter them when you authenticate later.

After being prompted for your Designsafe username and password, you should get a response from clients-create that looks similar to this:
```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/clients/v2/my_client"
        },
        "subscriber": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/profiles/v2/vaughn"
        },
        "subscriptions": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/clients/v2/my_client/subscriptions/"
        }
    },
    "callbackUrl": "",
    "consumerKey": "fMYfhijQE8ajqcKaswlGH4D5sngh",
    "consumerSecret": "8FZ6K9QwN1PY6bA9SOcyi4oaEkMa",
    "description": "Client used for app development",
    "name": "my_client",
    "tier": "Unlimited"
}
```

Although much of the process of interacting with the Agave API is automated, you may need access to the {{consumerKey}} and {{consumerSecret}} for other types of OAuth2-based interaction, so please record them. If you lose them, you can create new copy of them for the same client by deleting the old client and creating it again. You can also have multiple OAuth2 clients - we are simply demonstrating use of one.

*This completes the section on obtaining a set of API keys.*
