# Designsafe Files tutorial

Working with files and folders in Designsafe's Files service works the same regardless of the type, location, or protocols used by the underlying storage.

## Browsing

Here's how to list the home directory of a specific ```username```

```sh
files-list username
.
octocat.png

```

That was the summary view. View all attributes of every file or folder by adding the verbose flag: ```files-list -v username```

```json
[
    {
        "_links": {
            "history": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/history/system/designsafe.storage.default/username"
            },
            "metadata": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/meta/v2/data?q={\"associationIds\":\"7044784514159415781-242ac112-0001-002\"}"
            },
            "self": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username"
            },
            "system": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/systems/v2/designsafe.storage.default"
            }
        },
        "format": "folder",
        "lastModified": "2016-02-28T14:07:58.000-06:00",
        "length": 32768,
        "mimeType": "text/directory",
        "name": ".",
        "path": "username",
        "permissions": "ALL",
        "system": "designsafe.storage.default",
        "type": "dir"
    },
    {
        "_links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/octocat.png"
            },
            "system": {
                "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/systems/v2/designsafe.storage.default"
            }
        },
        "format": "raw",
        "lastModified": "2016-02-28T14:07:59.000-06:00",
        "length": 3987,
        "mimeType": "application/octet-stream",
        "name": "octocat.png",
        "path": "username/octocat.png",
        "permissions": "READ_WRITE",
        "system": "designsafe.storage.default",
        "type": "file"
    }
]
```

Find out details about a specific file or folder by specifying its path: ```files-list username/octocat.png```


## Uploading

You can upload data into Designsafe storage by performing a multipart POST on the FILES service. Using the CLI, recursive directory uploads are supported. If you are manually calling ```curl```, you will need to manually create the directories and upload the local contents one at a time. You can take a look in the ```files-upload``` script to see how this is done. Let's go ahead and upload a file to use in the rest of the tutorial.


```sh
files-upload -v -F lorem.txt username
```

Response:

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "history": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/history/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/lorem.txt"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/lorem.txt"
        },
        "system": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/systems/v2/designsafe.storage.default"
        }
    },
    "internalusername": null,
    "lastModified": "2016-02-28T14:20:51.386-06:00",
    "name": "lorem.txt",
    "nativeFormat": "raw",
    "owner": "username",
    "path": "username/lorem.txt",
    "source": "http://172.17.0.1/lorem.txt",
    "status": "STAGING_QUEUED",
    "systemId": "designsafe.storage.default",
    "uuid": "4401627548025875995-242ac112-0001-002"
}
```

If you specify ```-N name``` when uploading, the file will be renamed as it is sent to the storage resource. For instance, ```-N ipsum.txt```.


## Importing data from a URL

You can also import data from an external URL, so long as it is available without authentication. Rather than making a multipart file upload request, you can pass in JSON object with the URL and an optional target file name, file type, and array of notifications which should be made when the import completes. The next example will import a the README.md file from a public git repository in Bitbucket.

```sh
files-import -v -U "https://bitbucket.org/taccaci/agave-samples/raw/master/README.md" username
```

Response:

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "history": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/history/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/README.md"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/README.md"
        },
        "system": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/systems/v2/designsafe.storage.default"
        }
    },
    "internalusername": null,
    "lastModified": "2016-02-28T14:28:36.759-06:00",
    "name": "README.md",
    "nativeFormat": "raw",
    "owner": "username",
    "path": "username/README.md",
    "source": "https://bitbucket.org/taccaci/agave-samples/raw/master/README.md",
    "status": "STAGING_QUEUED",
    "systemId": "designsafe.storage.default",
    "uuid": "2869171603221442075-242ac112-0001-002"
}
```

Notes: Importing data from a third party is done as an asynchronous activity. This means that while you will get a response from the API server right away, it may take some time before the data is available in the system. This means if you perform a file-list on the file as it is being imported, the value you get back may be incorrect. In this exercise, the file was just a few KB, so you should see it appear in your home folder almost immediately. If you were importing larger datasets, the transfer could take significantly longer depending on network quality and resource availability. In this case, you would see the file size continue to increase until it completed. In the event of a failed transfer, the files API will retry 3 times before canceling the transfer.

## File operations

Similar to a POSIX filesysten, we can create, copy, move, rename, and delete files and folders. Let's try these out on one of the files we just uploaded.

```sh
$ files-mkdir -N newfolder username
Successfully created folder newfolder

$ files-list username
.
lorem.txt
newfolder
README.md

$ files-copy -D username/newfolder/lorem.txt username/lorem.txt
Successfully copied username/lorem.txt to username/newfolder/lorem.txt

$ files-list username/newfolder
.
lorem.txt

files-move -D username/newfolder/lorem2.txt  username/newfolder/lorem.txt
Successfully moved username/newfolder/lorem.txt to username/newfolder/lorem2.txt

$ files-list username/newfolder
.
lorem2.txt

$ files-rename -N lorem.txt username/newfolder/lorem2.txt
Successfully renamed username/newfolder/picsumipsum2.txt to username/newfolder/picsumipsum.txt

$ files-delete username/lorem.txt
# Warning: The files API will perform recursive deletion on folders, so be careful!
Successfully deleted username/lorem.txt

$ files-list username
.
newfolder
README.md
```

## Provenance

Designsafe keeps track of the provenance and history of every file object under its purview. Here's an example showing the provenance of the ```lorem2.txt``` file we just created.

```
files-history -v username/newfolder/lorem2.txt
```

Response:

```json
[
    {
        "created": "2016-02-28T14:36:25.000-06:00",
        "description": "File item copied from https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/newfolder/lorem.txt",
        "status": "CREATED"
    },
    {
        "created": "2016-02-28T14:38:02.000-06:00",
        "description": "Moved from https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/newfolder/lorem.txt to https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/newfolder/lorem2.txt",
        "status": "MOVED"
    }
]
```

## Downloading

You can easily download a file or folder from Designsafe's storage. As with uploads, you can specify a flag to rename the file on the fly.

```sh
files-get -N downloaded.txt username/newfolder/lorem2.txt
######################################################################## 100.0%
```

Add the recursive flag ```--recursive``` to download a directory.


## Multiple Systems

Designsafe is architected around providing federated access to multiple file storage locations. By default, user files are stored in ```designsafe.storage.default``` and the public NEES datasets are found in ```nees.public```. Others may be added to the system as the project progresses. To list all available storage resources at Designsafe, use the ```systems-list``` command.

```sh
systems-list -S
nees.public
designsafe.storage.boxsync
designsafe.storage.default
```

If you look at the tutorial material above, you'll notice that all file operations we've done to date were on the ```designsafe.storage.default``` system.

## Working with other storage systems

Let's use a specific NEES data set on the ```nees.public``` system as an example.


List all folders (this is the equivalent to visiting ```https://designsafeci-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/data/public/``` in your browser).

```sh
files-list -S nees.public /

.

examples
facility.groups
go
nees
NEES-2005-0002.groups
NEES-2005-0004.groups
NEES-2005-0006.groups
...
```

List a specific directory:

```sh
files-list -S nees.public /facility.groups/UTexas
.
Contact
EducationOutreach
Equipment
neesUTexas1p.pdf
sensors
TrainingAndCertification
```

Download a specific file to your local system:

```sh
files-get -S nees.public /facility.groups/UTexas/neesUTexas1p.pdf
######################################################################## 100.0%
```

Import a specific file from ```nees.public``` into your Designsafe workspace

```sh
files-import -v -U "agave://nees.public/facility.groups/UTexas/neesUTexas1p.pdf" -S designsafe.storage.default username
```

Response:

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "history": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/history/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/neesUTexas1p.pdf"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/files/v2/media/system/designsafe.storage.default/username/neesUTexas1p.pdf"
        },
        "system": {
            "href": "https://agave.designsafe-ci.org/systems/v2/designsafe.storage.default"
        }
    },
    "internalUsername": null,
    "lastModified": "2016-02-28T15:04:04.027-06:00",
    "name": "neesUTexas1p.pdf",
    "nativeFormat": "raw",
    "owner": "username",
    "path": "username/neesUTexas1p.pdf",
    "source": "agave://nees.public/facility.groups/UTexas/neesUTexas1p.pdf",
    "status": "STAGING_QUEUED",
    "systemId": "designsafe.storage.default",
    "uuid": "3734420596388392475-242ac112-0001-002"
}
```

Result:

```sh
files-list -S designsafe.storage.default username
.
neesUTexas1p.pdf
newfolder
README.md
```

# Sharing files with Designsafe collaborators

```sh
files-pems-addupdate
```
